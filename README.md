- App (android) with an n-back training game: https://github.com/jitseve/Memeolise
- WODPacer: app (java, andoid) to help with pacing in crossfit-like sports with a machine learning model (not available publicly)
- Firestone: an implementation of the backend of the card game hearthstone in clojure (not available publicly)

### Own projects:

- Thesis project: mobile application (kotlin) to detect the pose of a golfer during swing, a backend (python, flask) to turn an existing phase detection machine learning model into a restApi, and subsequent data anaylsis (not available publicly)
