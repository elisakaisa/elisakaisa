Hi there ðŸ‘‹\
I'm Elisa, a master student in sports technology at KTH. 
I'm interested in anything sports technology related, especially to its applications to elite sports.
Iâ€™m currently working on various study-related projects.

Projects I've collaborated on during my master's:
- Getting ground contact times in sprinting by using Suunto's movesense IMU: https://github.com/jitseve/IM4UWebApp 
- Training diary app (android) for crossfit: https://github.com/jitseve/XFran
- App (android) that connects to an external IMU sensor: https://github.com/jitseve/MoveAble
- App (android) with an n-back training game: https://github.com/jitseve/Memeolise
