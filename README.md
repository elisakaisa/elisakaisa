Hi there ðŸ‘‹\
I'm Elisa, a master student in sports technology at KTH. 
I'm interested in anything sports technology related, especially to its applications to elite sports. I'm also very interested in mobile application development.
Iâ€™m currently working on various study-related projects, which include mobile applications for Android and machine learning.<br>
In my freetime, I'm learning Flutter, playing around with a Polar H10 sensor and mobile applications (Android-Java).<br>
Feel free to reach me at: elisa.k.perini(@)gmail.com
